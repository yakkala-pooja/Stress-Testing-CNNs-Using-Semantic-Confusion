# Stress-Testing-CNNs-Using-Semantic-Confusion
Implemented Semantic Confusion, a generative OOD attack using BART and diffusion models to create misleading image-caption pairs. Evaluated ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet256 and Intel datasets. Proposed Perceptual Concept Shift to measure semantic misalignment via Grad-CAM, BLIP, and CLIP.
